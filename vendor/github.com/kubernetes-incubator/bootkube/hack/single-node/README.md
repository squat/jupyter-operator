# Hack / Dev single-node build

**Note: All scripts are assumed to be ran from this directory.**

## Quickstart

This will generate the default assets in the `cluster` directory and launch a single-node self-hosted cluster.

```
./bootkube-up
```

## Cleaning up

To stop the running cluster and remove generated assets, run:

```
vagrant destroy -f
rm -rf cluster
```
